# Capstone Project 1
1. What goal will your website be designed to achieve?

    My goal is to create a to-do app that uses the Slack API by receiving messages sent in Slack and turning them into to-do items.

2. What kind of users will visit your site? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?

    My demographic are Slack users that want a fast way to update their to-do lists from Slack.

3. What data do you plan on using? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain.

    I plan on using the Slack Events and Web API.

4. In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not
know everything in advance and that these details might change later). Answer
questions like the ones below, but feel free to add more information:
    - What does your database schema look like?

        My database schema will have users and items tables to start with.

    - What kinds of issues might you run into with your API?
    - Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?

        User information, to-do items and passwords.

    - What functionality will your app include?

        Managing to-do items, syncing with Slack, sending reminders to Slack and/or email.

    - What will the user flow look like?

        Authenticating through Slack and logging in, adding to-dos and viewing them based on dates. Can easily open Slack from within the app.

    - What features make your site more than CRUD? Do you have any stretch goals?

        The site is more than CRUD because of the integration between Slack and the planning/sorting options for the app.
