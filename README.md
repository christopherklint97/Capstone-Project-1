# What is Dolt?

[Dolt](dolt.christopherklint.com) is a task manager that is integrated with Slack through Oauth login functionality and slash commands for viewing adding tasks and groups.

I chose these features because I wanted to keep the web app fast and simple while still allowing for great practicality from a Slack workspace.
